# FinTax - Tax Accounting Blockchain Platform

## Problem
Users of a tax accounting blockchain platform may experience difficulty accessing insights on their portfolio and blockchain transactions. The current process may lack a natural flow and not be user-friendly. The challenge is to create a user-friendly portal for the chat application with an interactive interface. Users should be able to interact with the application using natural language and receive responses in a conversational manner.

## Solution
Our solution to this problem is to develop a platform with user-friendly interface that consists of an integrated chat bot to help the user access all the features easily and maintain their taxes in a more accessible and secure way. The chat application is powered by the OpenAI API and utilizes the power of GPT 3.5 Turbo model. The chat application can answer the doubts related to the tax accounting system in the blockchain technology. The model is specifically trained for understanding tax accounting and blockchain-related queries and is fine-tuned using relevant data from the tax accounting blockchain platforms to improve its accuracy and domain-specific understanding. 

## How  does it work:
* A user looking to use the platform can simply open the app on their smartphone or tablet. The platform would ask for the user's login credentials or if it is a new user and it will ask him/her to create a new account. The user will then be redirected to a new page and can access the dashboard which will display the protfolio of the user.
* The user can use the inbuilt chat application feature to ask his/her personalized doubts from the accounting platform. The chatbot can also be used to ask more generalized doubts.

## Technology Used:
* React: Used to build the frontend of the platform.
* OpenAI API: Used for the chat application
* HTML: Basic Structure of the website was built using HTML.
* CSS: Styling of the website.
* JS: Responsiveness of the website.
